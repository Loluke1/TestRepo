			You are to write a report of around 1000 words describing your IT project idea. You
should describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or
interesting, and any potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see?
What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to
make you qualified for your ideal job?
Page 6 of 12
You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to
have some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these
questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all three, but it is quite
likely that something you would find interesting or useful will have a similar effect on
others.
There are several possible types of projects that you may consider. Some potential
ideas are below; others will be discussed in the following weeks.
Developing a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d.
Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you
have expertise, or by using tools such as MIT App Inventor.
Finding an innovative application for new hardware developments, such as
Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, small robots or related technologies.
Creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot, possibly involving speech-to-text
and text-to-speech software.
Building an electronic artefact such as a model for Minecraft or similar games, along
the lines of the United Nations Block by Block project.
For this assignment, you need to write approximately 1,000 words about your project
idea.
This should not only describe what the project would be, but also why you think it is
important or interesting, and what potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
The project idea that you put forward should have elements of originality and
innovation, it doesn’t have to be re-inventing the wheel - but isn’t to be effectively
cloning an existing product or service. There is to be a strong sense of grounding, so
in terms of the feasibility of your ideas for an IT project it should be able to be
produced within the next ~5 years of technology progression at most (nothing Sci-Fi).
There isn’t a set expectation of complexity to the project you select and explore, and
it doesn’t necessarily have to be something commercially viable, but, perhaps aiming
for such could help you settle certain questions or help form your own (and
tutors/graders) perspectives towards it.

Your description should include the following sections. The word counts below are
recommendations only not absolutes but are a good guide of a minimum.
Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.
Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be
interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as: "There
service. are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an
automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily
assembled solution to this problem."
Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or
service
Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or
other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.
Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including
software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it
be to find the skills, software and hardware required?
Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How
will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?
