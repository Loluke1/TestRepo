				<h3>Summary</h3>
				Over lockdown it has become apparent that without the usual physical
				social avenues, I've realised how difficult it can be to connect with
				people who are wanting to pursue a common hobby. This can be anything
				from jamming with other musos or organising a group to play D&D.
				'Who's Keen?' is a project designed to facilitate the quick organisation
				of casual groups. The service will have two main 'elements':
				users and groups. <br />
				Users will have a profile which will provide a summary of their group
				membership history. They will also have a calendar, drawing events
				from groups. <br />
				Groups will allow basic functionality such as IM and photo sharing,
				potentially voice/video channels & calendar tools.

			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				Over the course of the 2020 lockdown, I realised just how much I relied
				on my physical correspondence with my friends and colleagues. Over the
				course of a couple of lockdowns I realised that organising meetups or
				groups for various things were falling through or garnering little
				attention, often with their announcement being utterly buried in a
				group chat within a few days, forgotten shortly thereafter. Having a
				platform for organising groups, projects or even one-off events would
				theoretically maximise the chances of getting people interested or
				onboard.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				Who’s Keen?’ will provide a simplified, single-purpose space for
				bringing groups and events into being. Its focus is narrow so that it
				may allow rich and meaningful features to be implemented into it.
				This stems from the fact that several services can provide a similar
				surface experience, but organising groups & events is rarely a primary
				focus. As such, we have stripped the service back to the most important
				parts so that these shine on their own. To describe these, it is
				probably best that I describe the environment from the user perspective.
				<br />
				When a user creates an account, they will have a very basic profile set
				up where they add a Bio and select a few things they are interested in
				being involved with. These interests will allow the user to browse a
				list of public groups based on their interests. The user may also know
				of friends who have an account, in which case they will add their
				friends to their friends list. Over time, as more of their friends
				adopt the platform, they will have what will hopefully be two rich
				lists of groups: the public list and the friend list. <br />
				Let us say that this user is wanting to form a group of their own –
				this should be a simple task. The group will have a few attributes,
				such as public/private, a description, and tags. For example, let us
				say that George wants to play Dungeons & Dragons with his friends. He
				would create a private group, adding a description of the campaign he
				is running and how many people he is hoping to have join. Once this
				is done, he would add a few tags to help the group be visible to those
				most interested – perhaps D&D and TTRPG. Now that his group is
				created, a few friends see the posting and join the group. George now
				creates an event within the group, titled ‘Session Zero’ and schedules
				it for this Friday from 6:00PM to 9:00PM over video call. Members
				would ideally confirm their attendance – this would add the event to
				their calendar. <br />
				Let us look at another use case. Ruth is new to Melbourne and wishes
				to find local musicians to hang out and jam with. After creating her
				account, she creates a public group and adds the relevant description
				and tags. She would then set the member controls to only allow people
				to join after being approved by the admin(s) – Ruth in this instance.
				Every few days she checks on the group and allows a few people to
				join. Once the group reaches capacity, she schedules a recurring event
				to take place every Saturday arvo in her garage studio. <br />
				Finally, let us look at Jeremy, who is a friend of George and plays
				the drums recreationally. He likes the look of the D&D campaign so
				joins up. He is free on Friday so accepts the invitation to ‘Session
				Zero’ – this gets added to his calendar. He then sees that Ruth has
				scheduled a jam session for Saturday but may be helping a friend
				move. As such, he selects the option ‘may attend’, and finds a feint
				event added to his calendar.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
				The platform would involve a few key components: a server to manage the
				databases (users, groups, events, etc.), a web portal for users to
				access the platform from virtually any device, and a mobile app to
				allow easy access to all the platforms primary features on the move.
				The server would likely be implemented on a cloud platform such as AWS to
				enable simple scalability and distribution of the services.

			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				The skills required to produce ‘Who’s Keen?’ can be seen by breaking
				down the components of the platform. <br />
				Let us start with the back end. The backbone to the platform is the
				database holding the user data, group data, event data and the
				relationships between these (friends, users members of groups, etc.).
				As such, an understanding of databases and their administration would
				be an essential skill to have. Having this implemented would also
				require skills in server administration and an understanding of cloud
				concepts. <br />
				Second, we need to integrate this into two interfaces – the app
				interface and the web interface. The first would be implemented by
				somebody with skills in mobile app development, and the latter with
				skills in web development. There is likely to be a fair bit of cross-
				over between the implementations from the UX/design perspective and
				from the database-integration perspective. <br />
				Finally, the project will need a plan for marketing to ensure that
				it’s adopted by enough users for it to reach a ‘critical mass’.<br />
				An additional nicety would be to have proper e2e encryption. A method
				of monetising the platform would be important to keep in mind too –
				perhaps a premium subscription, advertisements or perhaps enterprise
				licencing – each of which would need more skilled individuals to
				implement.<br />

			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				Once fully implemented, the platform would provide people with a great
				pathway to develop new social groups based around common interests and
				to more easily organise events. As such, the original problem outlined
				in the opening would be solved. Once monetised, it may even be
				properly viable for long-term, large-scale implementation and be
				profitable.

			You are to write a report of around 1000 words describing your IT project idea. You
should describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or
interesting, and any potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see?
What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to
make you qualified for your ideal job?
Page 6 of 12
You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to
have some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these
questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all three, but it is quite
likely that something you would find interesting or useful will have a similar effect on
others.
There are several possible types of projects that you may consider. Some potential
ideas are below; others will be discussed in the following weeks.
Developing a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d.
Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you
have expertise, or by using tools such as MIT App Inventor.
Finding an innovative application for new hardware developments, such as
Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, small robots or related technologies.
Creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot, possibly involving speech-to-text
and text-to-speech software.
Building an electronic artefact such as a model for Minecraft or similar games, along
the lines of the United Nations Block by Block project.
For this assignment, you need to write approximately 1,000 words about your project
idea.
This should not only describe what the project would be, but also why you think it is
important or interesting, and what potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
The project idea that you put forward should have elements of originality and
innovation, it doesn’t have to be re-inventing the wheel - but isn’t to be effectively
cloning an existing product or service. There is to be a strong sense of grounding, so
in terms of the feasibility of your ideas for an IT project it should be able to be
produced within the next ~5 years of technology progression at most (nothing Sci-Fi).
There isn’t a set expectation of complexity to the project you select and explore, and
it doesn’t necessarily have to be something commercially viable, but, perhaps aiming
for such could help you settle certain questions or help form your own (and
tutors/graders) perspectives towards it.

Your description should include the following sections. The word counts below are
recommendations only not absolutes but are a good guide of a minimum.
Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.
Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be
interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as: "There
service. are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an
automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily
assembled solution to this problem."
Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or
service
Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or
other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.
Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including
software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it
be to find the skills, software and hardware required?
Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How
will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?
