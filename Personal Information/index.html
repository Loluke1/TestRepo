				<h2>The Novel Stuff</h2>
			<div>
				I grew up in Albury on a small farm 15 mintues from town. I took a
				gapyear and worked as an IT trainee at my highschool. It was a pretty
				cushy job split into two parts - level 1 helpdesk for students & staff,
				and training on various enterprise IT systems (AD, Papercut, Canvas, etc.).<br />
				My cultural background is a bit of a mixed bag, with dad's side of the family
				coming from Scottland, Wales and England, whereas mum's side are all
				Italian migrants. Thankfully I inherited my dad's height and my mum's
				cooking skills! <br/>
				Over the years I've dabbled in around a dozen languages, but
				my most notable experiences were:
				<ul>
					<li>Learning HTML and some CSS in year 6</li>
					<li>Making flash games in year 8 with ActionScript</li>
					<li>Learning MATLAB, C and R while at RMIT</li>
				</ul>
				Further, I'm a proficient bassist, having played for 7 years or so.
				I've also recently begun taking some blacksmithing classes on weekends,
				and have so far found the craft to be increadibly rewarding and fun.
