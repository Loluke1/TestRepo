			<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			Over the past few years I've begun to realise the importance of
			cybersecurity jobs well into the future. Learning more about CyberSec
			reminded me of all the things I love about IT - enterprise systems.
			My interest in this area began on my gap year when I was successful in
			becoming my schools first IT trainee. Going into the role I had only a
			narrow understanding of what a career in IT would involve - I knew only
			of programmers and 'IT guys'. By the end of the year, I had been able to
			work on a range of projects i several fields, from network upgrades to
			SoE development and deployment, to managing hypervisors and their backups.
			<br />I was hooked. So when I started digging into what was required of a
			full-time cybersecurity consultant, I knew that there would be a long but
			enjoyable road ahead. <br /><br />
			Here is an example of one of my ideal, long-term jobs:<br />
			<a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Tesserent&t=Principal+Security+Consultant&jk=81c0f91f639f8262&q=cyber+security+$149,000&vjs=3">
				<img src="../static/IdealJob.png" style="width:50%;"/>
			</a><br />
			The gap year left me with strong helpdesk and customer service skills,
			which I feel would be absolutely essential as a consultant. Despite this,
			my technical skills and understanding are certainally underdeveloped. To
			combat this, I'm studing things such as networking and cloud computing in
			my own time. Formalising this study would be almost essential, especially
			when it comes to being employed, as it's the simplest way to prove that
			these concepts are understood and can be applied to something as
			wide-reaching as cybersecurity.

		Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may
require several years of experience, and hence be something that you must work
towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to fill as
soon as you graduate.
There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like {seek.com.au}.
You should include the following information.
• The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link
expires before the assignment deadline).
• A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this
position appealing to you.
• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required
for the position.
• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you
currently have.
• A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required
for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed,
(and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as
you can
