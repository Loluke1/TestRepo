		Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may
require several years of experience, and hence be something that you must work
towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to fill as
soon as you graduate.
There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like {seek.com.au}.
You should include the following information.
• The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link
expires before the assignment deadline).
• A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this
position appealing to you.
• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required
for the position.
• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you
currently have.
• A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required
for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed,
(and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as
you can
