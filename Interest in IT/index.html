			<h2>Interest in IT - A New Hope</h2>
			<i>A young farm boy, Luke, is thrust into a galaxy of adventure when he
			discovers an ancient tome in the great library of Trinity (Thurgoona).</i>
			Silly O.T. references aside, my interest in IT began at an <br />
			early age whenI made my first webpage by
			following the lessons in an old "Dummy's Guide to HTML" book from the
			school library. I was quickly hooked on making simple pages for nearly
			anything - favourite books, recipes and video games were the most
			memorable of these.<br />
			Shortly thereafter, an uncle of mine learned of my newfound interest in
			creating webpages and suggested that I practice making them on an old
			laptop that my parents had. As was to be expected, it ran increadibly
			slowly. This lead to my second brush with interesting IT - linux.<br />
			My uncle showed me how to install and use a very beginner friendly
			disto which I still use from time to time: linux mint. Learning how the
			terminal worked was a lot of fun, although at this age I found it tedious,
			still preferring to use a UI for most things. <br /><br />
			There were too many other experiences to list and describe here, but I
			feel that these were the onces that the rest were built upon. They've
			ultimately lead me to spend my gap year as a full time IT trainee at a
			local school and to my newfound interest in cybersecurity.<br />

			<h2>RMIT - Higher Education Strikes Back</h2>
			<i>The Rebels flee south, to the city of Melbourne to forge a better
				future for themselves. However, their income forces them into a
				shoebox.</i><br />
				I chose to come to RMIT for a number of reasons. In no particular order
				I'll discuss a few of these. <br />
				The campus' proximity to the CBD was a big plus in my books. I knew it
				would be fairly easy to access from nearly any suburb so long as I was
				close to a train line.<br/>
				The variety of courses on offer was also an important factor for me, as
				I came out of my gap year without a clear vision of what I wanted to do
				long term. As such, starting my programme
				(<a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/undergraduate-study/bachelor-degrees/bachelor-of-science-applied-mathematics-and-statistics-bp083">BP083</a>)
				felt like a pathway that would at least get me moving in a direction I
				knew would be helpful in some capacity.<br />
				The emphasis on making graduates job ready was something I was pleased
				to see also, as I knew I'd be keen to get back to full-time work after
				graduating.

			<h2>Further Education - Return of The Jedi Mindset</h2>
			<i>The final installment of the young Jedi sees him struggle against the
				Dark Side - the powerful pull of procrastination and mediocraty. Will
				our hero triumph?</i><br />
				During my studies I'm hoping to gain a solid grasp of the fundamentals
				in as many areas as I can manage in my third year of study. I'm
				currently enrolled in both this course and the Networking 1 course. I'm
				also undertaking some more 'maths meets computer science' courses, such
				as Algebra for Information Security, and Cryptography.<br />
