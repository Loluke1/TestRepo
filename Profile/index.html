There are a number of online tests that are commonly used by employers to get
specific information about potential employees. One of the best-known of these is the
Page 5 of 12
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test, which was developed by the mother-anddaughter team of Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs. Another popular one (and very
relevant to students) is about learning styles.
There are various other tests available online as well, and while there is no guarantee
that any specific test will be necessarily one that you will encounter in your career, it
seems highly likely that you will have to do some kind of test like this as part of a
recruitment process.
Accordingly, you are required to present the following information:
• The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.
• The results of an online learning style test.
• The results of one further online test of your choosing.
The third test should be distinct from both the Myers-Briggs test and the learning
styles test.
This could be a Big Five Personality test, a creativity test, or a psychometric test. You
should be able to find something free, and please ensure that it is something that a
potential employer may find relevant (so please avoid things like a Nerdy Personality
Attribute assessment or a Generic Conspiracist Beliefs test!).
In addition to the results themselves, you should answer each of the questions below
with one paragraph.
• What do the results of these tests mean for you?
• How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
• How should you take this into account when forming a team?
